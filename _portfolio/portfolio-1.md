## 1. Sentiment and Emoji analysis on Youtube comments
The first analysis is regarding a database with comments from multiple YouTube videos.<br>
I used TextBlob, a NLP library to perform the sentiment analysis and Wordcloud library to present the most common words, in positive and negative comments, in a visual and appealing way.
Since emojis are so common nowaday, I also did some analysis regarding emojis in the comments.

## 2. Youtube Category Analysis
The second analysis is regarding video category and shows.<br>
Given the amount of shows and videos all over Youtube (this dataset has more than 300k entries), I decided to make four questions:

1. Which Category has the most likes?
2. Is the the audience engaged?
3. Which channels have the trendiest shows?
4. Does Punctuation in the Title have any relation with views, likes, dislikes?

## 3. Future Work
- Go more in depth in the analysis. For example, instead of aggregate all countries data, do an analysis by country.
- Create a Tableau/PowerBI dashboard where is it possible to show findings dynamically
